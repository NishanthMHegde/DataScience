AB Tests are useful in determining changes to a website. A is the previous state of thr website and B is the new state of the website 
which we want to test out. AB Tests have to be carried out for a decent amount of time so that all types of customers can be accounted
for. AB Tests are generally used for accounting for changes for E-Commerce websites.
They can be used for determining the following types of changes:

We can use t-tests/ t-statistics and p-values to determine which of A or B might be better. 
1. Pricing changes
2. UI changes
3. UI workflow changes
4. Order quantity
5. Order amount

We should, however be careful while selecting the time frame for executing the tests and the customer group we target.
Few pointers that have to be kept in mind:
1. Time or month during which we start our test. We should be wary of the holiday seasons like Diwali or Christmas 
because the spending trends changes during these festival seasons.
2. We should carefully choose the customer group we use for tests. If we have chosen a group of peple for testing 
the website ourseves, we should have proper distribution of customers for both A and B. We cannot afford to have
all good customers in one group and bad customers in another. 
3. We should be aware of the random variance which is inevitable to come up in our tests. There is no way we can totally
prevent it. We should inform our business owners about the random variance. 
4. We should learn to take these results with a pinch of salt because of the random variance and probable presence
of bots who can skew our results or the time during which we conduct the test.
5. There is a high chance that old customers might get attracted to the new UI and have a few more clicks or purchases
	but the new customers might not recognise the changes and be neutral. But after a few days, the old customers might
	like the old UI better and the new customers might not like the website. It can go both ways.
6. Some times less favourable or more favorable results can be because of an intermediatery page or some other
process in between and might not be linked to our new change. 
7. We should do an A/A test on our test customers periodically.
