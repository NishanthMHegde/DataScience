Bias and Variance

Bias: We take the mean of all our predictions and check how far the mean of predictions is from the 
	actual real value. If the mean of our predictions is very far from real value, then it means that
	our predictions are highly biased. Bias can be in different directions as well.

Variance: Variance is how far our all our predictions our scattered around our observation. High variation
implies very high scattering of all our predictions from the real value.

4 scenarios: 
 a. Low bias high variance
 b. High bias low variance
 c. Low bias low variance (ideal real world expectations)
 d. High bias high variance

 In the ideal world, we should work towards reducing the error and not towards reducing the variance of bias.
 Error is usually computed by the formula:
 error = bias*bias + variance

 Variance and bias come into picture during the over-fitting or under-fitting of data.

 When a data is fit properly, there will be very less variance and moderate bias.
 When there is over-fitting of data, the variance will be very high but the bias will be very low.
 We need to reduce error which is inevitable in over-fitting and underfitting of data.
 We need to arrive at a proper balance.
