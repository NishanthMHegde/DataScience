Data warehouse is a collection of large amounts of data which is centralized.
This data is present in a particular form which can have a schema or a particular method of representation
and is queries by using SQL queries or a tool like Tableu. NoSQL databases can also be used.
Data warehousing is often present as a seperate department in companies which have or need
large amounts of data like Amazon, Google , e-commerce websites ike Flipkart, etc.

There are two common ways of managing data. They are ETL and ELT.

1. ETL (Extract, transform and load): This is a traditional method of data warehousing. In this method,
the data that is required is first extracted. Data can be extracted from multiple sources like internet forms, web forms 
or web logs.
After the data extraction process is complete, this data is transformed into a form which can be used to co-relate values
from different databases and use a column of one table with a column of another table. For this a particular schema is required
and the transform step transforms the extracted data into a form which is organized and consumable.
The load step is used to load the transformed data i
nto the data warehouse so that the data can be analysed and used
by the data scientists or big data experts/operators.
This process can however get tricky if we were to deal with big data or large volumes of data.


2. ELT (Extract, load and transform): This method bucks the traditional form of data warehousing and is used by industries
which have the capability to use Big Data principles or tools like Hadoop or Hive to work with big data.
In this method, the data is first extracted from different sources like web logs.
This data is then loaded as-is into the data warehouse.
Big data tools like Hadoop and Mapreduce are used to transform the big data in-place into the required schema/format
which can be used for data analysis in the data warehouse. This step is not computationally expensive and saves a lot
of time.
